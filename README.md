IPChecker
=========

Simple Qt-based tray daemon that retrieves a machine's public IP address and uploads a file containing the IP to a given FTP server.

This software was used to aid with finding the external IP of a machine to remote in. Simply start it, and it works from the background to keep an FTP server up to date with the latest IP address.
